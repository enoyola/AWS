# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing Terraform module for Zerto Cloud Appliance (ZCA) deployment on AWS to follow infrastructure-as-code best practices while maintaining the Zerto-specific IAM policy and AMI requirements. The refactoring will improve modularity, reusability, security, and maintainability of the Terraform code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a well-structured Terraform module with proper variable inputs, so that I can deploy ZCA instances in different environments and regions with customizable parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the module is used THEN it SHALL accept configurable input variables for VPC CIDR, subnet CIDR, instance type, region, and common tags
2. WHEN variables are provided THEN the module SHALL validate input parameters to ensure they meet AWS requirements
3. WHEN no variables are provided THEN the module SHALL use sensible default values
4. WHEN the module is applied THEN it SHALL support deployment in any AWS region

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper network security controls implemented, so that the ZCA instance is protected with appropriate security groups and network access controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the module creates networking resources THEN it SHALL create dedicated security groups with specific ingress and egress rules
2. WHEN security groups are created THEN they SHALL follow the principle of least privilege for network access
3. WHEN the EC2 instance is launched THEN it SHALL be associated with the appropriate security groups
4. WHEN network interfaces are created THEN they SHALL not use hardcoded IP addresses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Terraform user, I want clear outputs from the module, so that I can reference important resource attributes in other parts of my infrastructure code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the module completes successfully THEN it SHALL output the instance ID, private IP, VPC ID, and subnet ID
2. WHEN outputs are defined THEN they SHALL include descriptions explaining their purpose
3. WHEN the module is used as a child module THEN parent modules SHALL be able to access these outputs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want consistent resource naming and tagging, so that I can easily identify and manage ZCA resources in the AWS console.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are created THEN they SHALL follow a consistent naming convention using a configurable prefix
2. WHEN tags are applied THEN all resources SHALL receive common tags including environment, project, and purpose
3. WHEN resource names are generated THEN they SHALL be descriptive and include the resource type
4. WHEN the module is deployed THEN resource names SHALL be unique within the AWS account

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Terraform developer, I want the module organized into separate files, so that the code is maintainable and follows Terraform best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the module is structured THEN it SHALL separate variables, outputs, and main resources into dedicated files
2. WHEN the module includes documentation THEN it SHALL have a comprehensive README with usage examples
3. WHEN the module is organized THEN related resources SHALL be logically grouped within the main configuration
4. WHEN the module is complete THEN it SHALL preserve the original Zerto IAM policy and AMI ID requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want the networking components to be properly configured, so that the ZCA instance has reliable connectivity and follows AWS networking best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VPC resources are created THEN they SHALL include proper DNS resolution and hostname assignment
2. WHEN subnets are created THEN they SHALL be placed in available availability zones automatically
3. WHEN internet connectivity is required THEN the module SHALL create and configure internet gateway and routing properly
4. WHEN network interfaces are created THEN they SHALL use dynamic IP assignment unless specifically configured otherwise
