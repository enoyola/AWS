# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create module structure and variable definitions
  - Create variables.tf file with all input variables, validation rules, and descriptions
  - Create versions.tf file with provider version constraints
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement security groups for network protection
  - Create security group for ZCA management access (SSH, HTTPS)
  - Create security group for Zerto application-specific ports
  - Configure ingress and egress rules following least privilege principle
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Refactor networking resources with dynamic configuration
  - Update VPC resource with DNS support and configurable CIDR
  - Update subnet with availability zone data source and configurable CIDR
  - Enhance internet gateway and route table with proper tagging
  - Remove hardcoded IP addresses from network interface
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 4. Update IAM resources with consistent naming and tagging
  - Apply consistent naming convention to IAM policy, role, and instance profile
  - Add comprehensive tagging to all IAM resources
  - Preserve original Zerto IAM policy JSON content
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.4_

- [x] 5. Refactor EC2 instance with enhanced configuration
  - Update instance resource with variable-driven configuration
  - Associate security groups with the instance
  - Apply consistent naming and tagging
  - Preserve original AMI ID as required by Zerto
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 2.3_

- [x] 6. Create comprehensive output definitions
  - Create outputs.tf file with all required output values
  - Add descriptions for each output explaining their purpose
  - Include instance, networking, and security group outputs
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Organize main.tf with logical resource grouping
  - Group IAM resources together with comments
  - Group networking resources with proper ordering
  - Group compute resources at the end
  - Remove provider configuration from main.tf (will be handled externally)
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive module documentation
  - Create README.md with module description, usage examples, and requirements
  - Document all input variables, outputs, and their purposes
  - Include example usage scenarios and deployment instructions
  - _Requirements: 5.2_

- [x] 9. Validate module functionality and structure
  - Run terraform validate to check syntax and configuration
  - Test variable validation with various input combinations
  - Verify all outputs are properly defined and accessible
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
